Although <code>npm</code> itself can be used for build automation (see <a href="http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/">&quot;How to use npm as a build tool&quot;</a>),
we will focus on the specialised npm packages: <code>grunt</code>, <code>gulp</code> and <code>broccoli</code>. We will try to understand what problem they solve, how to use them
and what their limitations are.</p>]]></description><link>http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/04/18/tour-of-node-building-tools</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/04/18/tour-of-node-building-tools</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas Roch]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2015 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building with Grunt Part 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> is (or was) not <em>per se</em> a build automation tool.

So what is exactly Grunt? Since 4.0, Grunt is definitely a task runner... running tasks for automating builds!</p>]]></description><link>http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/04/18/building-with-grunt-part-1</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/04/18/building-with-grunt-part-1</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas Roch]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2015 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building with Grunt Part 2 Caveats]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="/posts/2015/04/18/building-with-grunt-part-1/">Building with Grunt Part 1</a>, we briefly talked about Grunt <em>&quot;configuration over code&quot;</em> approcah and its limitations (<strong>maintainability</strong>).
There is also another aspect of Grunt which doesn&#39;t make it the ideal build tool: <code>plugins</code> (tasks) are ranked higher than files. In other words: instead of performing a series
of operations on a group of files, we can only perform an operation (<code>task</code>) on different groups of files (<code>targets</code>). The consequences of this are:</p>]]></description><link>http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/04/22/building-with-grunt-part-2-caveats</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/04/22/building-with-grunt-part-2-caveats</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas Roch]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building with Gulp 3 and 4 Part 1 Examples]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Like <a href="/posts/2015/04/18/building-with-grunt-part-1/">Grunt</a>, <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a> is also a task runner but is designed to build applications using streams:
