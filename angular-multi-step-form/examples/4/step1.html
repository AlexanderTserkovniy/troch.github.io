    <h3>Markup structure and class names</h3>

    <p>Creating step transitions is made easy by the markup structure and class names
    added by this module.</p>

    <div hljs include="'/angular-multi-step-form/examples/4/markup-structure.html'" language="html"></div>

    <p>Animations are performed with <strong>$animate</strong>. You need to add <code>ngAnimate</code>
    as an application dependency:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            A leaving step <code>.form-step</code> will have <code>.ng-leave</code> and <code>.ng-leave-active</code>
            classes added to its main element if a CSS transition is detected.
        </li>

        <li>
            An entering step will have <code>.ng-enter</code> and <code>.ng-enter-active</code>
            classes added to its main element if a CSS transition is detected.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
