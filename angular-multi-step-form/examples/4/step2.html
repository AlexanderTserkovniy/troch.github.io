<div class="well">
    <h3>First step and transition direction</h3>

    <p>Depending on the animation you want to perform, you might want to have access
    to more information about a step transition. For example, if you have a sliding
    animation like this current example, you want to know if you are transitioning
    to the next step or to the previous step. That way you can slide left the leaving
    step and slide from the right the entering step if it is a forward transition, and
    the opposite if it is a backward transition.
    </p>

    <p>Also you might want to treat the first loaded step as a special case, either by
    not performing a transition or performing a different effect.</p>

    <ul>
        The following classes are added to <code>.multi-step-body</code> element:

        <li><code>.step-initial</code> for the first loaded step by the directive</li>
        <li><code>.step-forward</code> for a transition going forwards. This class is
        not added for the initial step</li>
        <li><code>.step-backward</code> for a transition going backwards.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
