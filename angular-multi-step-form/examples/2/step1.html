    <h3>Using forms</h3>

    <p>You can use forms in steps, however this doesn't change much. Each step can take a property <strong>hasForm</strong> (true or false, false by default)
    but this property is harmless: it doesn't do anything at all.</p>

    <p>This module is not opiniated about how to use forms. Have you ever used <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/">Angular UI bootstrap modals</a>?
    Steps are very much like modals: isolated units of business logic. Therefore, validation and decision to whether allow navigation to the next step
    should be performed in each step.</p>
