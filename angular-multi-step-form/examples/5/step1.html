<div class="well">
    <h3>Cancelling or finishing a multi-step form</h3>

    <p>In all previous examples, we demonstrated how we can allow a User to move
    forwards and backwards between steps.</p>

    <p>When you have a multi-step form, it is very likely that you will want a User
    to either confirm the completion of a multi-step form, or cancel the operation.</p>

    <p>You can supply to <code>multi-step-container</code> the <code>on-cancel</code>
    and <code>on-finish</code> expressions.</p>
